    estimate_covariance(timeseries::Vector, nsamp::Int, chunklength::Int)

Take a noise sequence (as a 1D vector or as columns of a 2D matrix) and
estimate the sample-sample covariance vector from these.

`nsamp` and `chunklength` are both optional arguments.

`nsamp` is the number of samples to compute from the covariance. If not a positive
number, then compute all possible values.

`chunklength` is the amount of data to be considered at once. If omitted, then this
will be either the length of the timeseries or 15*nsamp, whichever is shorter.

The idea is that a full computation is very inefficient. Making chunklength
much smaller than the timeseries length allows computation more efficient, but
at the cost of losing a small amount of correlation between values in successive
chunks. The recommended value for long data sets is to let chunklength be at
least 10-20x nsamp.

    main_exponentials(data, nexp; minexp=nothing)

Find the `nexp` "main exponentials" in the time stream `data`.

Specifically, follow the prescription of P. De Groen & B. De Moor (1987).
"The fit of a sum of exponentials to noisy data." J. Computational & Applied
Mathematics, vol. 20, pages 175–187.

We build a Hankel matrix H whose columns are contiguous segments of the time stream.
Perform a singular value decomposition to find the rank-`nexp` decomposition of H,
from which we can construct the square matrix A (of size `nexp`) which is known
to be similar to the "system matrix" (i.e., a time-step-advance matrix). The
latter has eigenvalues equal to the exponentials comprising the time stream, so
A (by similarity) has the same eigenvalues.

That's the best explanation I have. It might be more honest to say that we
find the exponentials by magic.

Note that the current implementation does not construct the exact SVD of H,
but rather uses a randomized matrix technique to compute an *approximate* SVD
very efficiently, containing only a specified number of leading singular vectors.

If `minexp==nothing` (the default), then only the length-`nexp` model is found.
If `minexp ≤ nexp`, then this function returns an array of arrays, one for each
value `p` with `minexp ≤ p ≤ nexp`, so that the length of the first is `minexp`
and the length of the last is `nexp`.

TODO: we need a better heuristic for constructing H out of a sufficient number
of segments from the data, without allowing it to get insanely large when `data`
is very, very long.

"""
    fit_exponentials(data; pmin=0, pmax=6, w=nothing, deltar=nothing, good_enough=0.0)

Fit the time series `data` (regularly sampled) as a sum of possibly complex
exponentials numbering at least `pmin` and at most `pmax`. Uses
`main_exponentials` to determine a starting guess for the exponential bases.
Then a nonlinear fit is attempted, using `NLopt` with the `:LD_MMA` method.

Returns `A,B`, the amplitudes and exponential bases of the best-fit model. The
length of either gives the order of the best-fit model.

# Optional Arguments:
The penalty function is a weighted sum-of-square-errors. If the optional
argument `w` is given, it must be a vector of the same length as `data`, and
then the penalty is the sum over all samples of `w[i]*(model[i]-data[i])^2`.

If `w` is absent, then the weights are taken to be all equal to `deltar^(-2)`.

If `deltar` is also not given, then it is estimated from the standard deviation
of the successive-differences from the last 1/4 of the samples in `data`, on the
assumption that these are noise-dominated. If they aren't, then the caller must
offer a better figure for `w` or `deltar`.

If `pmin` < `pmax`, then models of more than one order will be tried, and the one
with the lowest penalty function will be returned.

If `good_enough` is assigned a positive value, and if any model order `p<pmax`
produces a penalty function less than this value, then this function returns
early with the lowest-order model that meets the criterion.
